In the summer of 2019, I went to a farm in Swiss mountain and had memorable two week with a Swiss family.

There are lots of opportunities to live in a farm, doing labor work in exchange of food and accommodation in the [HelpX](https://helpx.net/). I decided to go to Swiss because there are really beautiful landscape and traveling in Swiss is really expensive. In this form, I can deeply experience local culture and don't need to speed much. Besides, the house owners speak French, so it is a good opportunity to practice my French. The photos above are their self-built house and the dreamy landscape when the fog comes.

I work 6 hours a day and 5 days a week. The labor work can be tough but the time is really not long, giving me chance to read books in front of ice mountain, chat with family members and travel in the weekends. My daily work include weeding, cleaning basement, caring animals, etc. There are three family members and many animals - dogs, cats, chickens, sheep, etc. The father is a smith and the mother is a nurse. But they only work half a week and use the rest of time caring their farm. The little boy Lucas is really cute and is going to entry primary school(a school that has ski class in winter, Wow.üèÇ)

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.




The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
