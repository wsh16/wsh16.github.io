As a important part of the engineering education in CentraleSup√©lec, all the students need to finish an internship of a month in the summer holiday of the second year. The internship must not be sitting in a office, because the school believe that it is necessary for the future engineers to understand how the real working conditions are in industry. Therefore, I chose to become a production line worker in the Renault Flins factory, spending 5 weeks screwing car parts, and more importantly, observing how a modern factory functions.
