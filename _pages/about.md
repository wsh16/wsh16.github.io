<!-- Hello world!

Still need to rerun docker to see new local deployment.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, this is Shuaihu. Obtained my master's diploma at the department of mechanical engineering, Tsinghua University, I'm currently a mechanical engineer at NAURA. You can find more about me in [my CV](/cv/), [research projects](/projects/) and [social activities](/activities/).

**In terms of personality**, I am optimistic, easy-going, emotionally stable and able to withstand pressure. I have lived in more than **5** different cities for more than **two** years, thus have strong adaptability to new environments and have communication skills with people from different environments and culture. 

**In terms of knowledge**, I major in mechatronics and have complete engineering background knowledge. Meanwhile, I have also taken courses like *microeconomics, business management, western philosophy*, so have a certain humanistic knowledge reserve.
