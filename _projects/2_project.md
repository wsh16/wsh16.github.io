## Backgrounds
Coal mining is a harsh and dangerous environment, but the complex terrain and small space make it difficult to apply ordinary automation equipment, so it is of great significance to develop new automation equipment. Our research team has developed a robot that can walk on the cable chute of the scraper conveyor in cooperation with the related group of the Department of Water Resources, and a mining equipment company. My job is to work with the team engineer in electronic design, coding and prototype manufacture.

## Robot Design

 Through the innovative design of the support structure and movement structure, the robot can walk on the cable chute of the original scraper conveyor with poor installation accuracy and low straightness, effectively utilizing the limited space and resources under the mine. The robot can be used to realize a number of tasks such as automatic coal and rock identification and unmanned monitoring under the mine, which can effectively improve the automation of coal mining.

## Prototype Manufacture

Making a prototype robot with our own hands is a process full of sweat and joy. Here is a photo me fixing the robot taken by another member of the lab.
